        <article><h3>My Childood</h3>
        <p>I was born and brought up in a very adorable family. I have grown up with my elder brother and my cousin whom i used to play a lot.
            I remembered each and everytime we used to play together. We loved to play buwan-buwan, slipper games, tago-tagoan, tumbang preso, and so on.
            I don't like playing some barbie dolls or wearing girly dresses. I loved watching movies like horror movies, action movies and I really loved to watch Jackie Chan's movies.</p>
        <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>
        <p>My teenage life is like being on a roller coaster. It's incredibly active, cheerful, and happening. On the other side, it is also incredibly demanding and confusing.
        I'm no longer a child or an adult. 
        They refer to us as teenagers. My school is where I spend a lot of time having fun with my pals. I think my pals can understand me better now than my parents can.
        My parents want me to act like a grownup since they claim I am no longer a child.
        However, they themselves act as though I'm a child and give me advice on everything I do. I want them to fully trust me, but I need some space.</p>

        <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
       <p> My Journey to Adulthood For my whole life, I have had a single thought that sometimes bothers me and causes me to worry about what kind of person I might turn out to be.
        Even when I was young, I frequently pondered my future plans. I started to experience a lot of stress due to my parents' ongoing demands that I start working at an early age and maintain my outstanding grades.
        Through it all, I understood that my enjoyment of spending time with my friends and spending the entire day playing video games on my newest console would change.

            <label style="display: inline;">Camiguin is famous for its tourist spots like White Island, Mantigue Island,
                 Mount Hibok-Hibok, and the recently-declared National Heritage Sites; 
                the Bonbon Church Ruins, and the Sunken Cemetery. <br>
                Although a booming tourist destination, Camiguin Island maintains its rural charm. Mostly because of 
                the locals who participate in preserving the natural beauty and heritage of their island.<br>

                    Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces
                     that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried,
                      or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.
